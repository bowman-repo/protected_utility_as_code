# M365 Protected Utility - automation of the configuration of M365 to elevate tennent to PROTECTED status under Australian Government Protective Security Policy Framework.
## DTA Office 365 Protected Utility configuration as code
This newly created projects objective is to utilise the principles of DEVOPS (infrastructure as code) to fully configure a M365 tennent, as detailed in the DTA Protected Utility Blueprints.
Automation of this process would enable the replication of a M365 Protected Utility Tennent, ensuring accuracy of configuration and rapid deployment.
